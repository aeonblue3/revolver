# loop

**Type**: `Boolean`, **Default**: `true`

This option is passed through the options object to the constructor. If `true`, the slider will loop infinitely. If `false`, it will loop at least once, or as many times as specified by the [iterations](iteration.md) option.

```javascript

var slider = new Revolver({
  loop: false
  // ...
});
```
